Challenge :
    Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate,
    and then generates them.
    (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number 
    in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers 
    in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
